# Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm 
![Logo](https://i.postimg.cc/7Zk1Tzc3/Zrzut-ekranu-2022-05-22-200014.png)


My greatest asset, is persistence in pursuing a goal, responsibility for entrusted duties and always doing my best. 
I am great with problem solving and finding optimal solutions, although I do not shun from asking for help.
I am not afraid to go beyond my comfort zone to gain new knowledge and skills.
I believe in the principle that working on self-improvement is hard, but with a substantial dose of patience and consistency, everything is possible.
